        <b>Brother from another mother</b> is the first thing that comes to my mind when I see him.
        He was the first guy I became friends with at Amity, though that happened midway through the first semester. The very first thing I remember saying to him was when I asked where Zaid was 😂, because they used to sit together.
        But oddly enough, that isn't my very first memory of him. I remember seeing him properly for the first time when he used to come wearing a cap, quietly sitting and writing his notes slowly. So slowly, in fact, that the physics faculty pointed it out . I remember these random little details so clearly, yet I can't quite recall the exact moment we became friends, though there were incidents that naturally brought us closer (GGs krishnan).
        One day during the first semester, I had to register my ID to access the library. For that, I had to go to the IT room after classes, since you get punched out for the process. I remember him waiting for me the entire time while I stood there. It was taking longer than expected, and I signalled for him to leave, but he insisted on staying and said he'd wait. That stayed with me.
        He was also my subtitler for the entire first semester and half of the second. I knew I would make friends here, but I never expected to find a brother.
        They grow in ordinary days and stay in your heart long after. Having a bond like this is something I'll always be thankful for one of those rare connections that turns a place into home. The brother everyone needs.

        ps: I did not cover 0.1 percent of what I could have(thats for some other day).

    Born to different moms, raised by our same poor choices, close enough brother.
    Great minds think alike.
