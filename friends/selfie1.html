        There is a saying that goes <strong>"Show me who your friends are, I'll tell who you are"</strong>. 
        Well if you look at them you'll think I am one of best people you will ever meet. 
        But its far from the truth. I have always been a guy who chases peace.....in them I found some. 
        Well I came from Chennai, knowing some broken hindi, sitting at the first bench of G15, barely talking to anyone.Its quite funny how I became friends with them. Its because of two anchoring events. One major and the other not so major.
        Among these three, Rai was the first person I formed a bond with and he is also the reason I became close with the other two, rizzy and bacchi.
        A large part of my happiness has their fingerprints all over it, stitched quietly into moments they probably don't even remember
        These are the guys that feel like home, the ones i am writing a para like this. Some people whose presence is more than enough.They turned unfamiliar corridors into familiar paths, turned random days into stories worth remembering
        These are the people who added life you to my delhi days. How luck I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard. 
        You guys will be in my 7 minutes. 
        ~ Forever in nostalgia
